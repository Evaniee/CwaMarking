# CwaMarking

A script to help speed up converting excel sheets for CWA course marking.

## Instructions
- Run **Excel.bat**
  - You may need to unblock the file in the file's properties.
  - Otherwise you may need to run it via CMD: 
    - Open **Command Prompt** or **Windows PowerShell**
    - `cd` to the directory of **Excel.bat**
    - run **script.bat** by typing `Excel.bat`
- This may take a while as the batch script will create a virtual environment and install the dependancies needed, **this requires a compatible version of Python 3** and then it will run the **Excel.py** file
- Follow the instructions in the program:
  - Select a file to convert
  - Select a directory to save to
  - Select the sheets to convert
  - Click convert
  - Close program when done
